## Relational Database: Sheet Metal Shop

This repo includes files related to a graduate school project wherein I created a mockup relational database for my dad's sheet metal shop. 

The following files are included:
- .sql file including the original SQL code
- .pgn file that displays the final reverse engineered model

Note 1: Some adjustments need to be made to the contract table as displayed in the relational model diagram.

- (I have the code on my laptop, but I'm going to clean it up before publishing)
</br>Note 2: I would also like to adjust the size of RelationalModel.png to better fit github.
