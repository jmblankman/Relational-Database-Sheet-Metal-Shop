## Relational Database: Sheet Metal Shop

This repo includes files related to a graduate school project wherein I created a mockup relational database for my dad's sheet metal shop. 

The following files are included:
- .sql file including the original SQL code
- .pgn file that displays the final reverse engineered model

  Note 1: I need to publish some adjustments to the contract table as displayed in the entity relationship diagram.
</br>Note 2: I would also like to adjust the size of RelationalModel.png to better fit github.
